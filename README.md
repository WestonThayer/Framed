## Building

Be sure to have node.js installed and then run `npm install` in this directory.

* `npm run sass` - build the .scss files
* `npm run sass-watch`- build and watch for .scss file changes
* `npm run minify-images` - compress any PNGs (run this if you add any new ones, manually replace images)

## Serving

You can use anything, just serve index.html.
